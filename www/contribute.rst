Contributing to GraphicsMagick
==============================

The future and success of GraphicsMagick depends on your contributions.
By contributing to GraphicsMagick you will benefit from the
features/fixes you contribute, can take pride in taking part in the
development of a quality product, and you can tell your friends that you
contribute to the GraphicsMagick project.

There are a number of ways you can contribute:

* Submit bug reports to the GraphicsMagick bug tracking system at
  SourceForge.

* Submit patches to the GraphicsMagick patch submission system at
  SourceForge.

* Perform test builds on unusual systems and report the results.

* Submit ideas and proposed designs to the graphicsmagick-core
  mailing list.

* Create a new language interface, dependent library, or application.

* Join the GraphicsMagick Group as a full-fledged developer with
  Mercurial commit access.

* Develop new 'convert6' and 'mogrify6' front ends which emulate
  essential option parsing features of ImageMagick 6.X while
  supporting operations currently in GraphicsMagick.

Regardless of how you choose to contribute, your contributions will be
treated with the respect and value that they deserve.

Becoming a member of the GraphicsMagick Group requires a majority vote
from existing members. Your chances of being admitted to the group are
increased significantly if you have a proven track-record of success
on other open source projects, are a recognized expert in the field,
or have already demonstrated your capabilities and commitment by
contributing to the project in other ways. Please contact Bob
Friesenhahn <bobjfriesenhahn@gmail.com> in order to be considered for
group membership.

Areas To Contribute
-------------------

The following are areas where significant contributions may be made to
the GraphicsMagick project:

* Create a language interface using SWIG <http://www.swig.org/> to
  support scripting in Perl, Python, TCL/TK, Guile, MzScheme, Ruby,
  Java, PHP, and CHICKEN, based on a common implementation.

* Create a new utility command parser based on a separate LALR or
  XML-based syntax definition, and using an approach suitable to
  replace the existing error-prone command parsers in magick/command.c

* Create a vector encoder for EPS, Postscript, PDF, SVG
  <http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/>, WebCGM
  <http://www.w3.org/Graphics/WebCGM/>, or WMF.

* Create an OpenEXR coder based on the OpenEXR
  <http://www.openexr.com/> library from Industrial Light & Magic.

* Create a *pstoedit* module to import Postscript, EPS, and PDF
  files as vector data using pstoedit <http://www.pstoedit.net/> which
  already includes a high-quality driver to render Postscript vectors via
  GraphicsMagick. This module could also export vector data in many
  formats using pstoedit's output drivers.

* Add integrated Adobe XMP
  <http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/index.html> profile support for
  TIFF, JPEG, PNG, PDF, EPS, and Postscript.

* Port Erik Reinhard's super-cool Parameter Estimation For
  Photographic Tone Reproduction
  <http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~reinhard/Reinhard02/> algorithm to
  GraphicsMagick.

* Create portable GUI which can work under Microsoft Windows, OS-X,
  X11, and Wayland (via a portable widget toolkit), to replace the
  outdated X11 GUI implmentation.

* Create an interface between GraphicsMagick and OpenOffice.org.
  <http://www.openoffice.org/> so that OpenOffice may load and save
  any format supported by GraphicsMagick. OpenOffice.org offers a
  separate SDK so there may be a number of other opportunities to
  explore.
